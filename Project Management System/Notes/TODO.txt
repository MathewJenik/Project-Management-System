---Implement UnnauthorizedAccess ActionResult and View

---implement PleaseLoginToView ActionResult and View



//

add the ability to have multiple user accounts being able to view a project, as well as being open to the public.

//

Implement the ability to create a new sub task for a task



// 

to load in the new task after subtask creation

i need to just add the new subtask by using innerHTML style stuff with +=
and i need to call the onloadprogress function that handles the initial loading of a task.

//

when a task is moved from incomplete or on progress, to complete. the progress bar should turn green on move and it should be set to 100%


//

fix bug rearding the name being used to change the status, not the id

// 

get status from inside:
onLoadSetProgress()
inside the api
once the info has been grabbed, check the status and act accordingly.
if it has been loaded inside a complete one set it to compelte state, else do normal stuff.
